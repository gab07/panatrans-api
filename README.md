# Panatrans API

API for the public bus tranportation system of Ciudad de Panam치 (Panam치).



## API Specification 
Specification for developers that plan to make a service or a mobile application based on this API

There are 4 types of resources:

* __Stops__: represent a bus stop. Includes a name and the (latitude, longitude) tuple.
* __Routes__: Represent bus routes, for example: the route from Albrook to Miraflores.
* __Trips__: A route generally has one or two trips. For example, the route Albrook - Miraflores has two trips: (1) the trip from Albrook to Miraflores, and (2) the trip from Miraflores to Albrook. Each trip has a set of stops that may be the same or not. There may be some routes that only have a single trip (ie: circular routes, those that start and end at the same location). 
* __Stop_Sequences__: Is the ordered list of stops for a particular trip. 


### ROUTES

#### GET /routes/
Gets all the routes ordered by name (alphabetical order)


```json 
{
  status : "success"
  data: [{

    },
    ...

  }
}
``` 

#### GET /routes/with_trips

		trips: [{
			id: INT, # trip id
			headsign: STRING, # "hacia Albrook"
			direction: INT, # 0=ida, 1= retorno
		}, ...
		]
	}, ...
	]	
}
			
```

#### GET /routes/:id

      headsign: STRING,    # "Hacia Miraflores"
      direction: INT,      # 0 =  ida, 1 = retorno
      stops: [{
        sequence: INT    # sequence,
        id: INT,         # 3 
        name: STRING,    # "Albrook"
